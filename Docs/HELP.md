# Help

This repo is to help alongside [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/steprescott/xcodegen) about [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen). This repo uses tags for different stages of the presentation so you will need to checkout each step along side the presentation to see the examples in context.

After checking out each tag please look to the `README.md` for the information about that tag.
