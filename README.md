# XcodeGen

This repo is the practical examples to go with [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/steprescott/xcodegen) about [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

It uses tags to progress from one step to the next. So once you have the repo cloned locally please checkout `step-1` tag and start from there.

`git checkout tags/step-1`

You can also take a look at the [pull requests](https://github.com/steprescott/XcodeGen/pulls). Here you can see a diff between each step and compare what a code review would look like between the `.xcodeproj` default method vs the XcodeGen method.

You can also filter the PRs for those that used the [xcodeproj](https://github.com/steprescott/XcodeGen/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Axcodeproj) method or those that used the [XcodeGen](https://github.com/steprescott/XcodeGen/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AXcodeGen) method.
