# XcodeGen

### Step 11
As we rely on XcodeGen to generate the project for us we have to run it each time we want to load the project. 

To help us we can use some Git hooks to automatically generate the project file for us when we checkout code.

This step adds a script that can be ran to install these Git hooks.
