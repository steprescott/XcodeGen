# XcodeGen

### Step 6
Now we are using XcodeGen to generate our project file for us. Notice we have also added `*.xcodeproj` to our `.gitignore`. From now on we won't be committing the project file into source control.

To generate the project file we now need to run `xcodegen` from the root of the project.

You must first have XcodeGen installed. The easiest way to get this is via homebrew.

`brew install xcodegen`
